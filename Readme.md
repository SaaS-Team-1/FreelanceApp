# Freelancing Student App
## Setup
To set up the project for the first time run the following:
```
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
asd

## Running
The setup script automatically builds the sites so you only have to run:
```
npm run dev
```
This deploys the website locally and initiates a firestore database, which will store data locally for faster access. The local website can be accessed through the following URL: http://localhost:3030/
